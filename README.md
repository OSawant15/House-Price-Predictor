House_Price_Prediction <br>
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.
On evaluating and comparing various models we conclude that RandomForestRegressor works the best for this dataset.
